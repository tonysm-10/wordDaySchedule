# Work Day Schedule
 
This is a daily planner designed to help employees with busy schedules manage their time effectively. The planner displays the current day at the top of the calendar, presents time blocks for standard business hours when scrolled down, and color-codes each time block to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. Users can click into a time block to enter an event, and save it by clicking the save button on the right of that time block. The text you save for each event is saved in local storage and stays there even after the page is refreshed.
